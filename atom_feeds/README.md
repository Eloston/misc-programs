# Atom feeds

This directory contains scripts for outputting Atom feeds to standard output.

Current feed generators:

* `lenovo_bios_update_check.py` - Generates an Atom feed of one item for the latest version of a support.lenovo.com driver download. Tested on firmware update downloads.
* `omahaproxy.py` - Converts omahaproxy.appspot.com data into an Atom feed
